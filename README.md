# Random-Forest-Model
A basic model that uses a random forest algorithm to make predictions of house prices by fitting the model with data such as total area, year the house was built, etc. Predictions are made using validation data and a mean absolute error value is calculated to determine the accuracy between validation and training data. This model was created while working through Kaggle's - 'Introduction to Machine Learning' course. The programming language used was Python and the IDE used was DataSpell as well as Kaggle's coding environment. 

## Random Forest Algorithm
Random forest is a supervised and flexible machine learning algorithm that mostly produces great results. Random forest works by building numerous decision trees and merges them together to get accurate predictions. Random forest has it's advantages such that it can perform both classification and regression tasks, as well as proving a solution to overfitting. A disadvantage of the algorithm is that a large number of trees can significantly slow down the algorithm which may result in a model being too slow for real time predictions.
